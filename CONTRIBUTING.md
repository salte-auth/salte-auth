# Contributing to Salte Auth

## What should I know before I get started?

### Salte Auth, Providers, and more

The extendability of Salte Auth enables us to build opinionated Providers on a generic core.

However, this means that issues aren't always caused by Salte Auth itself, but instead by a [Provider](https://salte-auth.gitbook.io/salte-auth/extending/providers) or [Handler](https://salte-auth.gitbook.io/salte-auth/extending/handler).

## How Can I Contribute?
