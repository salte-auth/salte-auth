## What is Salte Auth? 

Salte Auth is an OAuth2 and OpenID Connect compliant library.

Its purpose is to allow developers to quickly and easily log in their users while at the same time being generic enough to support any number of [Providers](usage/getting-started.md#what-is-a-provider).

**We'll quickly walk through what Salte Auth does first:**

- Allows you to log in _(and out for OpenID Connect)_ to a variety of [Providers](usage/getting-started.md#what-is-a-provider).
- Enables you to [automatically secure routes](usage/getting-started.md#link-to-secure-routes) in your application or your entire application.
- Enables you to [automatically enhance api requests](usage/getting-started.md#link-to-secure-endpoints) with your authentication token.

**Finally what Salte Auth doesn't do:**

- Create or store user credentials (We aren't a [Provider](usage/getting-started.md#what-is-a-provider) and we're proud of it! âœŠ)
