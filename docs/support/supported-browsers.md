# Supported Browsers

![Supported Browsers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salte-auth/logos/master/images/supported-browsers.svg?sanitize=true)

_We test the current and prior versions of the above browsers, with the exception of only testing and supporting IE 11._

## Promise Polyfill

In order to run `salte-auth` on older browsers (such as IE 11) you'll need to polyfill promises.

Here's a list of well known ES6 Promise implementations developed by the community!

* [es6-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-promise)
* [native-promise-only](https://www.npmjs.com/package/native-promise-only)
* [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird)

**Any other ES6 Promise implementation will work as well!**
