# Getting Started

ðŸŽ‰ Huzzah! So you've decided to take the plunge into the wonderful world of Authentication!

This guide will attempt to quickly walk you through how you can utilize Salte Auth for authentication.

## Picking a Provider

### What is a Provider?

A `Provider` (Identity Provider) tells Salte Auth _who_ you're going to be authenticating with.

For a list of examples you should check out the [providers](providers.md) page!.

### ðŸ˜± Which Provider should I use?!?

That primarily depends on where your priorities are.

#### I need all the features!

If you're worried about SSO (Single Sign-On) then an OpenID Connect Provider like [Auth0](https://github.com/salte-auth/auth0), [Azure](https://github.com/salte-auth/azure), etc. are probably your best bet.

#### I'm not made of money!

If cost is more of a concern I'd recommend using one of the OAuth2 Providers like [GitHub](https://github.com/salte-auth/github), [Google](https://github.com/salte-auth/google), [Facebook](https://github.com/salte-auth/facebook), etc.

## Picking a Handler

### What is a Handler?

A `Handler` tells Salte Auth _how_ you're going to be authenticating.

For a list of examples you should check out the [handlers](handlers.md) page!.

## Setting up Salte Auth

### Install

```sh
# Install the Core
$ npm install @salte-auth/salte-auth
# Install a Provider
$ npm install @salte-auth/auth0
# Install a Handler
$ npm install @salte-auth/redirect
```

### Usage

```js
import { SalteAuth } from '@salte-auth/salte-auth';
import { Auth0 } from '@salte-auth/auth0';
import { Tab } from '@salte-auth/tab';

// Configure SalteAuth with Auth0's url and client id.
const auth = new SalteAuth({
  providers: [
    new Auth0({
      url: 'https://salte-os.auth0.com',
      clientID: '9JTBXBREtckkFHTxTNBceewrnn7NeDd0',

      routes: true
    })
  ],

  handlers: [
    new Tab({
      default: true
    })
  ]
});
```
